## Overview

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning techniques. The compressive strength of concrete is a crucial factor in construction, and predicting it accurately can assist in optimizing the concrete mix design.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [Concrete Compressive Strength Data](link_to_dataset). It includes various features such as cement, water, and aggregates proportions, which are used to predict the compressive strength.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **src**: Python scripts or modules for utility functions, data preprocessing, and model training.
- **models**: Saved machine learning models.
- **results**: Any output, logs, or visualization results.
- **requirements.txt**: List of project dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Annamalai-Subramani/Concrete_Compressive_Strength_Prediction.git
   cd concrete-strength-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the notebooks directory:

bash
Copy code
cd notebooks
Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:

01_data_exploration.ipynb
02_data_preprocessing.ipynb
03_model_training.ipynb
The trained model will be saved in the models directory.

Results
Include any relevant results, performance metrics, or visualizations obtained from the model.
